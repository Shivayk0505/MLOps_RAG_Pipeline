AEH - Advanced Application Engineer
Batch Eligible – 2026 Pass outs
Management Level – 11
ROLE OVERVIEW:
Work with diverse groups of innovators, to solve industries' and organizations' most challenging
problems. Use leading-edge technologies and strategies to reinvent the way every job is done
and help improve the way the world works and lives.
Create reusable software IP, crafting Small Language Models (SLMs) tailored to domain needs,
and reimagining legacy workflows as autonomous, agentic systems.
As an early-career AI-native engineer (0–1 years of experience), you will be at the forefront of
building domain-specific software platforms powered by GenAI and agentic codebases that drive
IP-led services. Your mission is to co-create intelligent, self-evolving, and continuously learning
systems that deliver transformational outcomes—at scale.
Key Responsibilities:
• Build Domain IP: Contribute to the creation of SLMs and reusable agentic modules tuned
to specific industries (e.g., banking, healthcare, supply chain) that serve as the foundation
of next-gen service offerings.
• Engineer with Purpose: Develop and evolve domain-aware AI agents that perform
business tasks traditionally done by human workflows, from document understanding to
decision-making.
• Architect the Software of the Future: Move beyond application delivery to design domain-
centered code frameworks that are self-learning, interpretable, and modular—ready to be
reused, extended, and monetized.
• AI-First Development: Use agentic development environments and AI-native tooling (e.g.,
Copilot, Claude, Gemini) to ideate, generate, test, and deploy software IP faster and
smarter.
• Collaborate Across Domains: Work with domain experts, cognitive architects, and data
scientists to embed enterprise knowledge into software, shaping how services will be
delivered in an autonomous future.
• Reimagine Workflows: Help dismantle legacy system boundaries by re-orchestrating
traditional processes into GenAI-powered experiences—infused with automation,
prediction, and learning.
• Lead with Data and Models: Actively engage in curating domain datasets, fine-tuning
SLMs, and experimenting with prompt engineering and retrieval-augmented generation to
maximize outcome accuracy and relevance.
• Operationalize Innovation: Integrate your work into production using scalable cloud-
native infrastructure, containerization, and MLOps/DevOps practices.
• Document technical specifications, maintain cloud resource diagrams, and keep track of
development and deployment activities.
• Continuously explore and experiment with the latest in AI and cloud technologies to drive
innovation and productivity improvements.
What we need?
We would love you to have:
Required Skills & Qualifications:
• Bachelor’s or Master’s in Computer Science, AI, or a related field.
• Proficiency in modern programming (e.g., Python, Java, Go, etc.) and exposure to
LLM/SLM tooling.
• Awareness of transformer models, GenAI architectures, and frameworks like LangChain,
RAG, or OpenLLM.
• Ability to think modular, reusable, and product-centric—building for IP, not just project
delivery.
• Exposure to agentic AI platforms and tools (e.g., CrewAI, AutoGen, AutoGPT,
OpenAgents).
• Familiarity with cloud-native technologies (AWS/GCP/Azure), serverless computing, and
containerization.
• Strong analytical mindset, curiosity, and a passion for reshaping software with
intelligence.
Preferred Skills:
• Experience building or fine-tuning SLMs or narrow-domain models.
• Exposure to building vector databases, semantic retrieval pipelines, and prompt
engineering techniques.
• Understanding of domain modeling, ontology creation, and enterprise knowledge
graphs.
• Knowledge of responsible AI principles and explainable AI practices.
• Early-stage contributions to open-source GenAI ecosystems or agent frameworks.
