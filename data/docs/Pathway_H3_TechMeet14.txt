About the Company

Pathway is shaking the foundations of AI by introducing the world’s first post-
transformer model that adapts and thinks just like humans.


Read and Upvote the BDH Architecture paper (if interested) on Hugging Face:
https://huggingface.co/papers/2509.26507


The breakthrough architecture outperforms Transformer and provides the
enterprise with full visibility into how the model works. Combining the
foundational model with the fastest data processing engine on the market
(the framework at your disposal for this year’s inter IIT), Pathway enables
enterprises to move beyond incremental optimization and toward truly
contextualized, experience-driven intelligence. We are trusted by organizations
such as NATO, La Poste, and Formula 1 racing teams.


Pathway is led by co-founder & CEO Zuzanna Stamirowska, a complexity
scientist who created a team consisting of AI pioneers, including CTO Jan
Chorowski who was the first person to apply Attention to speech and worked with
Nobel laureate Geoff Hinton at Google Brain, as well as CSO Adrian Kosowski, a
leading computer scientist and quantum physicist who obtained his PhD at the
age of 20 & co-founded SPOJ, one of the earliest popular competitive
programming platforms. The company is backed by leading investors and
advisors, including Lukasz Kaiser, co-author of the Transformer (“the T” in
ChatGPT) and a key researcher behind OpenAI’s reasoning models.


Pathway is headquartered in Palo Alto, California, has offices in Paris and
Wrocław, and hires exceptional talent remotely as well.

The Pathway Fra mework

The Pathway framework is a Python data processing framework designed for
analytics and AI pipelines over data streams. It is the ideal solution for real-
time processing use cases such as streaming ETL or Retrieval Augmented
Generation (RAG) pipelines for unstructured, changing data.


Key Components of this definition:

Python Framework: Written in Rust for speed and efficiency, Pathway is
usable via Python, making it powerful yet simple to use with just Python
know-how.

Data Processing: The Pathway framework excels at processing large-scale,
real-time data and is recognized as the world’s fastest data processing
engine. As a developer, you can use it for tasks like performing JOINS on
incoming data streams (real-time data flow) or updating vector/hybrid
indexes in real time. These are just simple examples, its potential goes
much further.

AI Pipelines Over Data Streams: The Pathway framework helps AI systems
learn from real-time data streams, enabling applications like sentiment
analysis, anomaly detection, and RAG pipelines that automatically adapt to
incoming data.

Problem St atement
Descript ion

Financial institutions run on continuous signals across investing, risk, fraud,
and customer engagement. Decisions lose value with every second of delay.
Yet most stacks are batch oriented, siloed, and brittle.


We know you have been learning. This year we push you to go pro mode
within clear rules. The difficulty is in applied GenAI. Expect a higher bar that
mirrors real production and delivers real impact


This is your mission, should you choose to accept it: build smarter
agentic applications that add value to real systems in the finance world.


Your application must run on the Pathway framework as the streaming data
engine. It must use what streaming unlocks in practice:


Always up to date metrics

Incrementally updated deterministic models (Streaming ML)

Ambient agents that react without prompts

Live indexes that refresh as documents and events change


Build something a real team could deploy and a real company could grow from,
not a classroom demo.


When companies deploy GenAI, they often start by redesigning processes. As
engineers, use a clear decision lens to select the right mix of agents, classical
machine learning, generative models, and RPA.



Exploit the Pathway framework as much as possible. Go beyond connectors
and live document indexing. Bring in stream processing, stateful windows,
incremental joins, the MCP server for real time analytics, and incrementally
trained classical models.


LLMs powered by Pathway BDH architecture learn on the go. Those models are
not available for this challenge. Use current (static) open or closed source LLMs
in combination with deterministic models that support incremental training/
Streaming ML.


Design for interoperability and orchestration so your system fits a world where
agents are common. Add guardrails. You can consider supporting Model
Context Protocol for tool access and agent to agent communication, including
A2A patterns when they make sense. Make agents observable, traceable, and
explainable. Log inputs, tools, parameters, and reasoning. Add scenario tests,
real time error detection, and sensible fallbacks.


This should lead to: one production grade, streaming native, agentic system
on the Pathway framework that ingests live or simulated streams, transforms
data incrementally, maintains live indexes for retrieval, reasons over a
continuously updated state, and takes the next best action with operator grade
transparency and controls.


While you design, you can try to envision how your architecture could evolve/
simplify when post-transformer LLMs like Pathway Baby Dragon arrive with
stronger reasoning, continual learning capability, and built-in interpretability.


Use-cases for your solution


This year’s problem statement is use-case agnostic. However, engineering
solutions for particular niche challenges is often a good idea from a value
creation perspective.





Ahead in this document, we’ve listed a few use cases (with hints) where
demand exists in the market.
Pick one or combine several if you can keep the scope coherent. You can go
beyond these, provided you validate the use case with substantiated research
or via conversations & testimonials with industry practitioners.
Also note that the same use cases might seem overwhelming. They’re doable if
you have team members with complimentary skills and it’s okay if you’re still
unable to implement all the specs. This use case list is just for you to get hints
about various components that matter.

Sample use cases/ideas

1. Real Time AI Investment Decision

Imagine a production grade system on Pathway that behaves like an AI
investment team. It ingests live signals, scores and ranks them, backtests on
the same code path, proposes trades, and adapts as outcomes arrive.

You could include:


Multimodal ingestion via Pathway connectors from market APIs, news and
RSS, social, filings as PDFs, and earnings transcripts, etc with parsing and
time alignment

Streaming signal detection with sentiment, event classification, anomaly
and risk indicators stored in a stateful knowledge base

Hypothesis generation and ranking using rules or simple ML/LLMs guided
by mission objectives

Batch backtests inside the same pipeline with returns, volatility, drawdown,
Sharpe, and constraint checks for limits and compliance

Trade proposal artifacts plus real time alerts when breaking signals land

Incremental updates using Pathway state persistence and online learning
patterns

Any sector or asset class, with alternative data when it supports the thesis


2. Live Credit Risk Evaluation and Next Best Action

Picture a real time credit flow on Pathway that keeps each borrower profile
current and suggests the next best action with clear operator visibility.

You could include:


Continuous ingestion from transactions, repayment behavior, bureau
updates, and macro or news signals

Real time recomputation of credit score and probability of default with
incremental state per borrower

Threshold driven actions such as review, tighten terms, request collateral,
adjust limits, or cross sell when risk improves

Human in the loop approvals where policy requires it LLM explanations
grounded in live indexed policy documents with simple Q and A for
reviewers

Reliable, scalable outputs to dashboards, databases, portals, or APIs
3. Continuous Fraud Monitoring and Instant Response

Model a live fraud shield on Pathway that inspects every transaction stream
and acts in sub second.

You could include:


Streaming ingestion for cards, transfers, or crypto with in memory
enrichment from profiles, geo, and device data

Rules, statistical anomalies, and graph style links for rings, with velocity and
sequence features using windows, aggregations, and joins

Incremental per event computations for high throughput

Instant alerts or actions such as decline, lock, or analyst notification via
queues or APIs

Joins with live sanctions or blacklist feeds and optional consortium pattern
feeds

LLM assisted SAR drafting grounded in current pipeline facts


4. Real Time Customer 360 and Personalized Engagement

Compose a streaming Customer 360 on Pathway for financial services that
keeps a live profile per customer and triggers timely, personalized engagement.
You could include:


Continuous ingestion from card payments, instant payment rails, ACH and
wire transfers, core banking ledger updates, trading and brokerage events,
loan and KYC updates, web and app events, support logs, and optional
consented social signals into a table keyed by customer or account ID. This
is a common streaming use case akin to the Kafka timestamps example on
Pathway’s website.

Triggers over the streaming profile using filters, joins, and windowed
aggregations such as churn risk, inferred life events, preapproved offer
eligibility, and fraud or AML anomalies. Focus on triggers that must respond
during authorization and instant payment flow.

LLM messages and 3 point summaries grounded in live indexed facts from
core systems, CRM, trading platforms, and service tickets. Keep each
message explainable with links to source records

A small scenario that measures event to action latency and demonstrates
relevance, for example a card decline, a large deposit, or a risky transfer
that triggers a personalized message, an agent script, or an extra
verification step. Report event time, decision time, and customer or agent
action time
5. Smart KYC Screener

KYC teams juggle identity docs, sanctions hits, PEP checks, and adverse media.
Workloads spike. False positives waste hours. You can build an interactive
screening copilot that automates level one checks, keeps a human in the loop
for edge cases, and explains every decision with evidence. Things you can
consider prioritizing:


Clean UI and understanding of how it either rivals or integrates into KYC
startups.

Interactive level one screening. Upload ID and company docs, extract
names and details, screen across OFAC SDN, UN, EU and UK consolidated
lists, local and vendor lists, and summarize hits with confidence, reasons,
and evidence links

Adverse media sweep. Pull recent articles and filings, cluster by topic,
highlight potential risk, and show the exact lines that triggered a flag

Deterministic plus LLM plus RPA. Use a rule engine for exact and fuzzy
matches, PEP and RCA classification, ownership checks like the fifty percent
rule, and freshness checks on lists. Use LLMs for disambiguation and plain
language summaries. Use RPA to open or update cases in your workflow
and core systems

Automate data capture from IDs and forms with grounded evidence via
advanced multimodal parsers. Handle passports, licenses, proof of address,
company registers, and beneficial ownership. Keep cropped image snippets
and field level citations for traceability

Track and display quality metrics such as hit rate, true positive rate, false
positive reduction, time to decision, and analyst time saved


Conclusion: How to use these ideas


The items above are ideas to spark direction, not tracks or
requirements. Use them as building blocks that you can mix and
adapt to your domain while keeping one coherent, production
minded system on Pathway. You may pursue a single end to end flow
or compose parts across ideas, as long as the streaming core,
observability, grounding, and evaluation standards remain clear.
Feel free to substitute data sources, models, and actions where
justified. You can also go beyond these examples if you validate the
use case with a practitioner.


Whether you focus on risk management, fraud prevention, investment
analysis, or customer engagement, the common essence is
automation with immediacy – the system reacts to data as soon as it
arrives, enabling intelligent next steps without delay.


By combining Pathway’s core abstractions i.e. connectors, tables,
transformations, and the powerful Rust-based incremental engine)
with modern AI elements such as deterministic models, incremental
training, and agent orchestration, you will demonstrate what real-time
AI looks like in practice.

Developer Resources

To ensure your project demonstrates strong real-time and production-readiness
capabilities, all teams must adhere to the following requirements and leverage
the official Pathway developer ecosystem. Exploit pathway to the max

1. Live Data Ingestion with Pathway Connectors

Your system must utilize Pathway’s real-time connectors to ingest streaming
data relevant to your chosen use case.

Pathway provides built-in connectors for files, databases, message queues,
APIs, and web sources, all operating in streaming mode, ensuring results
update in real time as data changes.

If your desired data source is not directly supported, you must extend
Pathway’s ingestion layer by implementing your own connector using the
Custom Python Connector. This allows you to adapt Pathway to new sources
and contributes to enhancing the engine’s capabilities.

Artificial Data Streams with the demo Module (in case you find it difficult to
access free streaming data APIs): https://pathway.com/developers/user-
guide/connect/artificial-streams


At least one live or simulated data feed must be integrated.

Examples include:

Subscribing to live market APIs (e.g., Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io)

Reading transaction streams from Kafka or sockets

Simulating live events via Pathway’s demo utilities


If live data is unavailable, teams may simulate streaming input by replaying
static datasets with realistic time intervals.
